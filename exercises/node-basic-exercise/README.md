##Basic Node.js Exercise
Write a short Node.js program that reads the text file `node.txt` and logs it to the console, with every occurrence of the expression 'Node.js' in green.

To color words in the console, you can use the node module [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk).

Bonus points for replacing in occurences where it isn't the whole word. (like "Node.js's" or "Node.js.").
