Node.js was invented in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, and other developers working at Joyent. Node.js was created and first published for Linux use in 2009. Its development and maintenance was spearheaded by Ryan Dahl and sponsored by Joyent, the firm where Dahl worked.

Dahl was inspired to create Node.js after seeing a file upload progress bar on Flickr. The browser did not know how much of the file had been uploaded and had to query the Web server. Dahl desired an easier way.

It garnered international attention after its debut at the inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009. Dahl presented Node.js, which combined Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event-loop, and a low-level I/O API. The project received a standing ovation, and has since then experienced significant growth, popularity and adoption.

In 2011, a package manager was introduced for Node.js library, called npm. The package manager allows publishing and sharing of open-source Node.js libraries by the community, and simplifies installation, updating and uninstallation of libraries.

In June 2011, Microsoft partnered with Joyent to implement a native Windows version of Node.js. The first Node.js build to support Windows was released in July.

In January 2012, Dahl stepped aside, promoting coworker and npm creator Isaac Schlueter to manage the project.

In January 2014, Schlueter announced Timothy J. Fontaine would be Node.js's new project lead.

In December 2014, Fedor Indutny started io.js, a fork of Node.js. Due to internal conflict over Joyent's governance, io.js was created as an open governance alternative with a separate technical committee.

In February 2015, the intent to form a neutral Node.js Foundation was announced. By June 2015, the Node.js and io.js community voted to work together under the Node.js Foundation
